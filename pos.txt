Taylor Alison Swift (born December 13, 1989) is an American singer-songwriter. Throughout her career, she has become one of the most popular female contemporary singers. She is known for narrative songs about her personal life, which has received much media attention.
Raised in Wyomissing, Pennsylvania, Swift moved to Nashville, Tennessee, at age 14 to pursue a career in country music. She signed with the independent label Big Machine Records and became the youngest artist ever signed by the Sony/ATV Music publishing house. The release of her self-titled debut album in 2006 marked the start of her career as a country music singer. The album's third single, "Our Song", made her the youngest person to single-handedly write and perform a number-one song on the Hot Country Songs chart. Swift's second album, Fearless, was released in 2008. Buoyed by the pop crossover success of the singles "Love Story" and "You Belong with Me", Fearless became the best-selling album of 2009 in the United States. The album won four Grammy Awards, with Swift becoming the youngest Album of the Year winner.
